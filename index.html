          <br>
          <p>STEMBoost is a 501c non-profit organization founded by a group of STEM savvy high school students to better educate elementary and middle school students in the field of STEM so that they can gain a better understanding of the field and perhaps even seek a career in STEM. These high school students are the alumni of the Kennedy Middle School Science Olympiad team who are the regional champion and 2nd place in Northern California for multiple years.
            STEMBoost also continues to support the Kennedy Science Olympiad team to ensure performance from year to year and maintain continuity between teams by assembling materials, knowledge, and experience for the Kennedy Science Olympiad teams.<br>
